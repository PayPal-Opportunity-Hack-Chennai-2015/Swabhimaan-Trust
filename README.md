Bring a smile to an autistic child by creating a system that will ensure tha the children get methodical care, screening and follow ups

Problem-Statement:
A system to provide multi-disciplinary approach for intervention in Autism spectrum disorder. Currently, there is no digitalized way to track the progress of an autistic child across various disciplines. 

Solution-Statement:
Develop a system where the treatment can be planned, tracked and analyzed in a systematic manner. We intend to build analytics around the past data to be able to propose a treatment plan, and corrective measures that the team of doctors/ therapists ought to take to effectively treat the condition of the autistic patient.
